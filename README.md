Translations for MultiMC5

To participate in the translation effort, go to [the MultiMC crowdin site](https://translate.multimc.org) and join the project.

Alternatively, you may want to grab the `.po` files you are interested in, make changes to them with [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) and then either make a pull request, or otherwise share the file(s).

If you want to add a completely new translation, it should be based on the [template](https://github.com/MultiMC/MultiMC5-translate/blob/master/template.pot) file. Some setup is required to add completely new translations, so please get in touch.

In all cases, you can get in touch with us on [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/jpRxkJ).
