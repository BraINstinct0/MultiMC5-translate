Translations for MultiMC5

To participate in the translation effort, go to [the MultiMC crowdin site](https://translate.multimc.org) and join the project and get in touch on [discord](https://discord.gg/rjpzCxvAPQ).
(If you don't have a Crowdin account, you can create one using your Facebook, Google, Twitter, Github, GitLab or any other email.)

You may want to use [POEdit](https://poedit.net/) to work on the translations. MultiMC allows putting a `.po` file in the translations folder and see changes in the application as you translate. Combined with its Crowdin integration, this is pretty powerful and comfortable to use.

Some setup is required to add completely new translations, so please get in touch.
